    "text": "Let me introduce myself—I’m Xiangwen Wang, a thoughtful, analytical thinker with a strong foundation in data science, business analytics, and strategic decision-making. I’m currently pursuing graduate studies, where I’ve worked on projects involving machine learning classification, forecasting, simulation modeling, and HR analytics. I enjoy transforming complex data into meaningful, actionable insights and presenting them in a clear and structured way to support better decision-making.\nBeyond academics, I’m someone who brings curiosity and care into every environment I step into—whether it’s a classroom, a team project, or a new city halfway across the world. I’m organized and detail-oriented, yet flexible and open-minded when plans shift. I value both independence and collaboration, and I love connecting with people and learning from different perspectives. Whether I’m navigating a dataset or a new place, I’m always seeking insight, growth, and meaningful experiences."
